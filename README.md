This is going to be a really excellent readme for a really excellent noteskin.

Right now this repository contains a copy of the SATAN-metal noteskin given to me by Jayce.

Hopefully this will act as a central portal for where to obtain this noteskin, and a useful log of changes and contributions going forward.
