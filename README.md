#What is this?
This is the DivinEntity noteskin for OpenITG/ITG/StepMania 3.95 presented by DivinElegy.

**THIS WIP BRANCH IN _NO WAY_ REFLECTS THE FINAL BUILD OF THE NOTESKIN. IT IS HIGHLY SUBJECT TO CHANGE.**

If you make anything using this noteskin, be aware the your simfile will very likely be incompatible with future versions. The latest, and most compatible version of the noteskin will always be in the master branch.

#Why?
The existing "God" and "Satan" NoteSkins floating around the Internet are ugly behomoths of cobbled together code with no real structure. They are hard for a novice to know how to use (and even for a relative expert). The DivinEntity NoteSkin aims to empower step artists with creative tools to make the best simfiles possible, without having to deal with too much bullshit.

From a code point of view, the main goal of the DivinEntity NoteSkin aims to remove as much Lua as possible from XML files and keep everything neat, organised and maintainable.
