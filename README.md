#What is this?
This is a WIP version of what will hopefully be a more standardised version of the so called God noteskin.

**THIS WIP BRANCH IN _NO WAY_ REFLECTS THE FINAL BUILD OF THE NOTESKIN. IT IS HIGHLY SUBJECT TO CHANGE.**

If you make anything using this noteskin, be aware the your simfile will very likely be incompatible with future versions. The latest, and most compatible version of the noteskin will always be in the master branch.
